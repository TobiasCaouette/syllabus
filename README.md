### Workflow

1. Fork the repository for the exercise/project (found under [github.com/uw-labview](https://github.com/uw-labview))
1. Clone the repository to your computer
1. Modify the files to complete your solution
1. Make sure all of your code is committed
1. Push/sync up to GitHub
1. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) on the original repository by the due time (generally the start of the following class)
1. You can continue to push fixes and improvements until the close date (listed in Classes) – just add a comment in the pull request to let me know it's been updated.

Feedback will be given in the pull request, so please respond with your thoughts and questions! You are welcome to open the pull request as the work is still in-progress if you are stuck and want to ask a question – just mention `@ukaratay` with the question to make sure I know to look at it sooner.
